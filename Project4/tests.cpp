/*
Possible tests:

- Check randomness of the random numbers
- Check that the local energies are always -4, -2, 0, 2, 4
- Check that global energies are always a multiple of the values in our table
- Check that the energy in our not-random matrix is always xxx
- Check that the magnetization in our not-random matrix is always L*L
